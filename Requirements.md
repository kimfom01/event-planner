# Event Planner App Requirements Document

## **Introduction**

The Event Planner App is a web-based application designed to allow users to create, manage, and participate in events. The app provides tools for scheduling, event tracking, RSVP functionality, and event visualization through a calendar view.

## **Project Objectives**

1. Enable users to manage their events efficiently.
2. Provide a clear and user-friendly calendar view of events.
3. Allow users to RSVP and track participation in events.
4. Support basic user authentication for event ownership and access control.

## **Key Features**

1. **Event Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete events.
2. **Calendar Integration**: Visualize events in a calendar layout.
3. **Event Details and RSVP**: View event details and RSVP for participation.
4. **Search and Filters**: Quickly find events by title, location, or date.
5. **Authentication**: Enable users to log in and manage their events.

## **User Stories**

### **1. Event Management**

- **As a user**, I want to create an event with a title, description, date, time, location, and participants so that I can plan gatherings.
- **As a user**, I want to update event details so that I can make changes if plans change.
- **As a user**, I want to delete events I no longer need so that I can keep my schedule organized.

### **2. Calendar View**

- **As a user**, I want to see my events in a monthly and weekly calendar view so that I can manage my schedule at a glance.
- **As a user**, I want to navigate between months and weeks to review past or future events.

### **3. Event Details and RSVP**

- **As a user**, I want to view detailed information about a specific event so that I know all the relevant details.
- **As a user**, I want to RSVP for events (e.g., mark "Attending" or "Not Attending") so that I can confirm my participation.

### **4. Search and Filters**

- **As a user**, I want to search for events by title or description so that I can find specific events quickly.
- **As a user**, I want to filter events by location, date, or status (e.g., upcoming, past) so that I can narrow down the list of events.

### **5. Authentication**

- **As a user**, I want to log in with my account so that I can manage my events securely.

## **Functional Requirements**

### **Event Management**

- Allow users to create an event with the following fields:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Date and time (required)
  - Location (optional, with Google Maps autocomplete integration)
  - Participants (list of emails or names, optional)
- Enable editing and deleting events.

### **Calendar View**

- Provide a monthly and weekly calendar view.
- Highlight days with scheduled events.
- Allow clicking on a date to view events for that day.

### **Event Details and RSVP**

- Display event details on a dedicated page.
- Allow users to RSVP with options like "Attending," "Not Attending," or "Maybe."
- Show a list of participants who have RSVPed (if applicable).

### **Search and Filters**

- Support keyword search across event titles and descriptions.
- Implement filters for:
  - Date range (e.g., today, this week, this month).
  - Location.
  - Status (e.g., upcoming, past).

### **Authentication**

- Implement user registration and login.
- Use authentication to restrict event management to logged-in users.
- Associate events with user accounts.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance**: Ensure smooth navigation and quick data loading for up to 1,000 events per user.
- **Scalability**: Design the backend to handle growth in users and events.
- **Security**: Use secure authentication practices and protect sensitive data (e.g., participant lists).
- **Responsiveness**: Make the app fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

---

## **Technical Requirements**

1. **Frontend**:

   - Use Remix for routing, data fetching, and actions.
   - Styling with Tailwind CSS or a similar framework.

2. **Backend**:

   - Use a PostgreSQL database for storing event data.
   - Use Prisma as the ORM.

3. **APIs/Integrations**:

   - Integrate Google Maps API for location autocomplete.

4. **Authentication**:

   - Use a library like Auth0, Supabase, or Firebase for authentication.

5. **Hosting**:
   - Host the app on platforms like Vercel for the frontend and a cloud database provider like Supabase or Planetscale for the backend.
